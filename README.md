#### LINKS
openEuler Website: https://www.openeuler.org/en/ 

### Task2: Experiencing openEuler
#### OBJECTIVE
Get to know more about openEuler by experiencing the openEuler operating system and itsâ€™ innovation projects through various ways. 
#### REQUIREMENTS
- Follow the instructions  based on your own preference, start a openEuler virtual machine
- Install openEuler innovation project: iSula, and try to download and run an iSula container
- Experience other openEuler features freely
- Take snapshot or pictures during OS installation, VM provision, iSula install and container launching
- Submit an issue to the openEuler codeheat repo, including the snapshot, pictures taken in previous step, and also your thoughts and feedbacks about openEuler
#### EXPECTED OUTCOME
- Successfully installed openEuler virtual machine
- Successfully practice basic openEuler commands and iSula usage
- Successfully learned how to communicate with openEuler community using github issues

### Step2: RPM Packaging Basics
#### OBJECTIVE
Learn the basics of  most widely used Linux software package distribution methods. Learn how to use RPM package
#### REQUIREMENTS
- Learn basics about RPM package format, inputs and outputs
- Follow the instructions to learn how to build a RPM package out from the codes edited in last task
- Use commands to install built RPM and run the program
#### EXPECTED OUTCOME

### Step3: openEuler User Repository(EUR) usage
#### OBJECTIVE
Despite the official software package repository, openEuler also provides a platform called openEuler User Repository(EUR), it allows users and developers to be able to build, test and run software packages before officially accepted and released by openEuler. EUR also provides build service for various openEuler versions and hardware architectures, this provides a very useful and convenient way for users and developers to add their favorite software. In this task, you will learn how to use it and add a our simple software package to your own EUR account
#### REQUIREMENTS
- Register EUR account and follow the instructions to create your own EUR project
- Learn how to build packages from pypi and git repo
- Learn how to include your own EUR repo in openEuler environment and use it to install packages
#### EXPECTED OUTCOME
- Successfully registered EUR account
- Successfully created EUR project and built RPM packages
- Successfully config and used your own EUR repo to install RPM packages
